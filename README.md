# Data Science 

The two files in this repository are Versions 1 and 2 of my class project.

During this project we were given a choice of selecting any topic to further analyze and visualize. I decided to focus on something that truly matters to me and that was my home city of New York City. Whenever I roam the streets of New York City, I notice how everything is changing, whether it's the street lamps, new buildings, or new streets, and it makes me wonder what the City Agencies' budget looks like. It is important to me that the City is using its money wisely and that the money can be trusted with these agencies. Ultimately my Project focuses on how the City is spending its money.


The data that I looked at for this project is the New York City Revenue Budget & Financial Plan -- Exec\Adpt\Prel and the New York City Capital Budget:
The Revenue Budget & Financial Plan -- Exec\Adpt\Prel can be found here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Revenue-Budget-Financial-Plan-Exec-Adpt-Prel/ugzk-a6x4 The Capital Budget can be found here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Capital-Budget/46m8-77gv

The techniques that I used during this project consists of the use of pandas and numpy for data wrangling, and I also used seaborn and matplotlib to help me plot line graphs and bar graphs. Furthermore I also used sklearn, statsmodels.api, and linear_model from sklearn to help create a regression model to help predict future trends of revenue and budget.
